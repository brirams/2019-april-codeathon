# Automating scholarship payments

## Who we are
AlumnUSB is a non-profit organization that raises funds for Universidad Sim√≥n Bolivar. It has several programs to help the university fulfill its academic mission, including sourcing goods (equipment for laboratories, classrooms, offices, and supplies) and providing grants in the form of scholarships and teaching awards. AlumnUSB is run by USB alumni volunteers around the world who volunteer their time.

## Problem statement
One of AlumnUSB's programs gives financial aid to students of the University with stellar performance. These transfers are made via [Uphold](https://uphold.com) since they handle identity verification and can guarantee that the money arrives directly to the intended recipient. This allows AlumnUSB to operate with transparency.

An AlumnUSB member must manually send transfers to all the grant recipients, a process that currently takes more than two hours every month. We would like a system that automates this process, as it will save a tremendous amount of human time and allow us to scale our operations.

## Challenge

* Make a script that connects to the [Uphold API](https://uphold.com/en/developer/api) to automate AlumnUSB scholarship payments.
* Bonus 1: Make a frontend for this script and have an UI that AlumnUSB's admins can use to interact with the tool you are creating.
* Bonus 2: Create a scheduler that automates the process of when and to whom send the financial aid.

## Skills needed
1. Backend APIs
2. Scripting

## Questions

- what are the inputs to this script? csv? excel?
- credentials management will be interesting
- This is backend heavy so I'd say 2 people for backend(figuring out upheld's api + building stuff, figuring out how to actually run/host the thing). 3-4 people if frontend is involved. Would say this is a solid medium.
